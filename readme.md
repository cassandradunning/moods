Exercise: Sleep Mode
Instructions
You decide to track how much your sleep affects your mood on a day-to-day basis. You notice that if you get less than 7 hours of sleep, you are grumpy all day long. If you get 7 or more hours of sleep, you are in a happy mood all day.

You start recording how many hours of sleep you get every night for two weeks. Based on the hours of sleep, you want to generate a readable report that shows you how many days you were grumpy and how many days you were happy.

There is an array provided to you in the starter code for your tracked hours of sleep. You need to complete the code using the above code as an example. One thing you will do differently is instead of putting the array in the output like the example does, you need to display the number of items in grumpyHours and the number of items in the happyHours arrays.


const hours = [ 6, 9, 7, 8, 6, 6, 8, 5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 9 ]
const grumpyHours = []
const happyHours = []

console.log()
